# Amusement Park Pass Generator: Part 2

Grade Attempted: Exceeds Expectations

Grade Acheived: Exceeds Expectations

Project Brief:

You will now take the foundation you created in Project 4 (Amusement Park Generator (I)) and add the User Interface for the app, along with a short list of new features and entrant types handling. You might need to refactor some code in order to accommodate these changes.

Upon completion, you will have a functional iPad app, created entirely yourself! The app can take user input and create personalized entrant passes for all the entrant types. When the passes are being swiped at different locations in the park, business rules such as whether the entrant is allowed to access an area, whether the entrant can get a discount, will be tested.
